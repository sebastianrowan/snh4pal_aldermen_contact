I am writing to express my support for the Ceasefire Resolution and request that you vote for it at the next council meeting. I am deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in Israel and Palestine and it is my conviction that the United States has a critical role to play in promoting peace and justice in the region. 

For the past 5 months, we have been calling and leaving messages to our state and federal representatives to push for a ceasefire, to no avail. We are asking you to pass this resolution, representing our voice, and join the movement of over 70 U.S cities and towns, including Durham and Lebanon in NH, in urging our government to not use our tax dollars to fund a genocide and instead call for a ceasefire. A resolution passed by a city carries more weight than individuals calling our representatives, and it builds on the values of human rights that we pride ourselves on as a community in Dover. Unlike other world conflicts including Ukraine, our federal government is funding the aggressor here using our federal taxes, supplying weapons, and providing diplomatic cover by vetoing ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council. As a city government, it is within your jurisdiction to represent our voice to our representatives in demanding a ceasefire. 

I hereby request that you support the ceasefire resolution which will be up for a vote on March 27th, and that this resolution:
• Acknowledges the disproportionate loss of lives in Gaza where over 31,000 Palestinians have been killed, over 70% being women and children, including 13,000 children.
• Requests provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza.
• Urges the release of all Palestinian and Israeli hostages.
• Urges the United States to reassert its leadership role as a negotiator, addressing the root causes of violence, and ending Israel's occupation and apartheid policies.


I sincerely appreciate your attention to these critical matters.
